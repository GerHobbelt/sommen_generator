  <h1>Create Calculus Exercise Leaf (= 'Chapter') - Documentation</h1>

  <p>This (web) tool can be used to generate unlimited series of calculus
  exercises for primary school children. You can either select one or more
  'presets' (Use CONTROL or SHIFT key with the mouse to select multiple presets
  at once) in the top half of the web form <a href=
  "calculus_gen_form2.html">here</a> or <a href=

    <dt>Exercise</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A single 'sum'.</p>

      <p>This use of the term 'exercise' is slightly off from the usual meaning
      in (primary) school. In this system, 'exercise' is a <em>single item to
      work on</em>. As the <em>basic element of this system</em> is the 'sum'
      itself and <em>not</em> the 'sheet' of paper it is printed on or the
      'task', i.e. the collection of sums of which this one sum will be but a
      small part, this may lead to a bit of confusion at first. See also why we
      use the term 'exercise' like that in the description of the term 'style'
      below.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Chapter</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A single collection of sums (exercises); often&mdash;but not
      necessarily&mdash;all these exercises are of one type (a.k.a. 'style').
      One 'chapter' can be thought of as one sheet of sums. Technically,
      'chapters' are sequence numbers identifying different sheets of exercises
      of the same type (or collection of types ('styles')).</p>

      <p>As such, <em>a 'chapter' number does not uniquely identify the
      exercise sheet</em>! (See the <a href="#sample4">fourth example</a> for a
      (partial) solution for this. See also the tips in the preceding examples,
      for example <a href="#TIP_remember_your_settings">here</a>, for other
      ways to cope with this.)</p>

      <p>Think of a 'chapter' as a single task or exercise sheet.</p>

      <p>'Chapters' are designed to be handed out to students as one-at-a-time
      tests: a 'chapter' is a unit of work for a student and should be
      completed on a single day. You may choose to hand out 'chapters' in
      bundles and/or request the student to complete multiple exercises
      ('chapters') on a single day; that is up to you and the situation.
      However, a 'chapter' should be completed, once started.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Style (a.k.a. 'type')</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>An exercise definition, which is used by the generator to
      produce/select a series of exercises of this particular type. A style,
      for instance, instructs the generator to produce <em>exercises</em> to
      help the student <em>exercise</em> a particular subject, say, the
      addition of integer numbers up to 20. (Hence the name '<em>exercise</em>'
      for a single 'sum'; once you arrive at the stage where you are going to
      test [the tables of] multiplication, division and, later still, fractions
      and beyond, the word 'sum' does not cover it anymore, as these are not
      'sums' (additions) but rather different calculus <em>exercises</em>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Preset</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A predefined style, or set of styles, with optional extra parameters.
      'Presets' are a technical solution, meant to help users of this calculus
      system produce exercise sheets (a.k.a. 'chapters') quickly and with
      maximum ease. Hence quite a few presets for 'first graders' (and several
      for students beyond that stage and age) are provided as one-click
      selections in the generator-driving <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html">web
      form</a>.</p>

      <p>Be aware that a 'preset' can contain one <em>or more</em> 'styles' and
      <em>can optionally contain additional parameters</em> to drive the
      calculus exercise generator. See the technical documentation if you wish
      to know more about presets, styles, their use and operation.</p>

  to the various features of the calculus exercise generator step by step.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Following through ('replaying') an example takes a few minutes only, and
    it is very useful to try a few (preferably: all of them) for you to get a

  <h3><a name="sample1" id="sample1">A basic example</a></h3>

  <h4>Goal &amp; Output</h4>

  <p>This example will produce a very basic set of simple calculus exercises
  for primary school children (age 6 years<a href=
  "#age_footnote1"><sup>&dagger;</sup></a>) and their parents and teachers.</p>

  <p>This example takes you through the (web) form and resulting page(s) of the
  calculus generator, in small, easy steps, showing you the basic use of the
  generator and its output(s).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We advise you to also try the next few examples, which slowly build up

  </blockquote>

  <h4>Execution</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Go to the <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html" target=
      "sample_exercise">web form here (opens in another window / tab in your
      browser)</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Go to the section titled <a href=
      "calculus_gen_form2.html#Select_presets_and_submit" target=
      "sample_exercise">Select preset(s) and submit</a> by either clicking on
      the link in the table of contents at the top of that page or by scrolling
      down.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>(Re-)set the 'Chapter' number to 1 (it should already show this
      value).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Then click on the item called 'simple additions in the range 1..10' in
      the (scrollable) preset pick list. This will be the second item in that
      list. Once clicked, this item will be 'marked' and consequently show as a
      line with a blue (i.e. 'selected' background).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Scroll down until you see the button titled 'OK to Generate'. (Keep
      the item values in the 'Page Setup' section as is: do not change those.)
      Click on the button ('OK to Generate') to submit your request to the web
      server; wait a little while for the generated exercise page to
      appear.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Now you can decide to print this page (and clip off the bottom section
      for perusal by a teacher or parent) or redo this action with the intent
      to <b>only</b> generate the exercises this time. Without the answers.
      <em>That</em> is going to be introduced in our <a href="#sample2">next
      example</a> too.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Results and Notes</h4>

  <p>Note that the exercise page includes <em>both</em> the exercises (4
  columns of them) <em>and</em> the answers to those exercises a little further
  down on the same page; one answer for each of the exercises.</p>

  <p>This is because the default <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html#Page_Setup"
  target="sample_exercise">Page Setup</a> configuration is to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Try to generate 64 calculus exercises on a single page. (Some
      presets/settings may result in fewer exercises; see the technical
      documentation for more info about and ways to 'get around' this.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Print the exercises in a 4-column format, so the exercises are nicely
      spread across the page.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Print/Show the generated exercises themselves.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Print/Show the corresponding answers.</p>

      <h3><a name="sample2" id="sample2">A basic example; exercises only,
      <em>no</em> answers</a></h3>

      <h4>Goal &amp; Output</h4>

      <p>This example will produce a very basic set of simple calculus

        "TIP_remember_your_settings">TIP</a></p>

        <p>If you wish to have a corresponding answer sheet, you can go back to
        the <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html#Page_Setup" target=
        "sample_exercise">Page Setup</a> section in that web form again and
        check 'Show Answer Sheet' (while maybe unchecking the 'Show Exercises'
        option, though it might be handy to keep the exercises with the
        answers, just to make sure you always keep the right answers with each
        exercises chapter (chapter numbers are <em>not unique</em> across
        presets/settings as you will find out in the <a href="#sample3">next
        example</a>).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="CenteredLargePrint">Want more exercises?</p>

        <p>If you wish to have more exercises, you can simply generate another
        series of additional exercises by incrementing the 'Chapter' number to
        2 (and beyond). There is <em>no</em> limit to the chapter number, so
        you can produce as much exercise material as you feel you need.</p>

        <p>Idea: you may even go so far as to create 'one-off' exercise sheets
        ('chapters') for each of your students so as to prevent students from
        quickly copying each others' work, by giving each of them their own
        personalized exercise sheet: by design, all 'chapters' in a preset
        produce a set of exercises of very similar (functional identical)
        complexity.</p>

        <p>If you require 'more complex'/'harder' exercises, you may wish to
        select a different preset. Or mix presets! The latter is shown in our
        <a href="#sample3">next example</a>, by the way.</p>

        <p>Note that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You can generate an unlimited number of exercise pages (called
            'chapters') with similar exercises by keeping your preset/settings
            as they are and just incrementing the chapter number.</p>

            <p>Though you can, I would advise you not to change <em>the number
            of exercises generated per chapter</em> ('Number of Exercises to
            Create', default: 64) <em>after you have begun using this
            system</em>. For more detailed info about the inner workings of
            this system see the technical documentation. Reading this too will
            also help you anticipate possible 'side effects' or other
            consequences of the use of this generator.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>You can <em>regenerate</em> the <em>exact</em> same set of
            exercises again <em>any</em> time in the future by remembering your
            preset/settings and <em>chapter number</em>: this (web) tool is
            constructed in such a way that, given a preset/setting and a
            chapter number, it will reproduce the exercises for that chapter
            <em>exactly</em> like it did before. Nothing is stored in the web
            server, so you must remember your selected settings and chapter
            number yourself. The chapter number is printed on each exercise
            sheet; presets and other settings can be (when 'Page Setup' has
            been configured to do so) printed at the bottom of the page.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="CenteredLittleLouderPrint">In short: Remember what you
              selected and wrote in that web form, and you can regenerate the

      <h3><a name="sample3" id="sample3">A basic example; mixing presets;
      create a mixed exercise set</a></h3>

      <h4>Goal &amp; Output</h4>

      <p>This example will produce a basic, <em>mixed</em> set of simple
      calculus exercises for use by primary school children (age 6
      years<a href="#age_footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>) and their teachers /
      parents.</p>

      <p>This example takes you through the (web) form and resulting page(s) of
      the calculus generator, in small, easy steps, showing you the basic use
      of the generator and its output(s).</p>

      <p>By mixing multiple presets, you can produce exercise sheets
      ('chapters') which, by containing a corresponding mix of actual
      exercises, can be used to test and exercise a set of knowledge learned so
      far. In this particular example, we are going to create a exercise sheet
      which includes both exercises testing the students' ability to perform
      basic addition in the value range 1 to 10, while also testing their (new)
      ability to extend on that knowledge and perform addition on the simplest
      values up to 20<a href="#calculus_levels_footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>We advise you to 'play' with the presets available on the web form
        once you've followed through this example to get a 'feel' for the way
        the presets work.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Don't forget to try different chapter numbers to see what will
          happen then!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We also advice you to try the <a href="#sample4">next example</a>
        because, while it may seem daunting at first, it also shows you a
        better view at the reach, i.e. the possibilities of the system, which
        will surely provide you with some new, refreshing ideas how to use this
        system to create any calculus exercises and/or test sets you may
        desire.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="CenteredLargePrint">ADVICE</p>

        <p>... though we would like to advise you to <em>always</em> print the
        exercises with the answers as this will enable you to verify you've got
        the proper answer sheet(s) with you at all times. Judiciously printing
        a little extra like that can save a lot of stress and confusion for you
        and consequently improve your efficiency and effectivity as your
        attention will not waver needlessly.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Also note&mdash;and this is the main purpose of this example compared
      to the previous ones&mdash;that the generator took your selected presets
      and produced a set of exercises which are a mix of the presets: by design
      the generator assigns equal priority to each of the selected 'styles'
      (most 'presets' have a single 'style'; the ones we selected in this
      example have only one 'style') and attempts to generate a balanced mix of
      exercises from these 'styles'. For more information about the concept of
      'styles', see our technical documentation.</p>

      <p>For now it suffices to conclude mixing presets will produce a similar
      mixed set of exercises.</p>

      <p>Some presets have titles/names which identify them as 'mixed', which
      implies those particular presets have been created to produce a mix of
      exercises all by themselves. Nevertheless, that should not keep you from
      mixing such 'combined'/'mixed' presets with any of the others. On the
      contrary: we encourage you to try this for yourself and see the results.
      This ability to mix an (unlimited) collection of 'styles' is very handy,
      for example when you wish to create tests to verify your students have
      grasped the material which was taught to them over a period of time, or
      when you wish to produce 'more complex' exercise sheets for advancing
      students.</p>

      <h3><a name="sample4" id="sample4">An advanced example; defining custom
      exercises as 'styles'</a></h3>

      <h4>Goal &amp; Output</h4>

      <p>This example will produce a custom, mixed, <em>extended</em> set of
      calculus exercises of varying complexity, while a strong focus is put on
      the tables of multiplication and a first glimmer of working with
      fractions is included for the advanced students. These exercises are for
      use by primary school children (age 6-8 years<a href=
      "#age_footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>) and their teachers / parents (as the
      answer section is included again).</p>

      <p>This example assumes you are at ease with the basic operation of the
      <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html">(web) form</a> and resulting page(s) of
      the calculus generator, as we are going to produce a custom 'style sheet'
      on-line, which will be submitted to the server to have it produce our
      desired exercise sheet.</p>

      <p>By mixing multiple presets, you can produce exercise sheets
      ('chapters') which, by containing a corresponding mix of actual
      exercises, can be used to test and exercise a set of knowledge learned so
      far. In this particular example, we are going to create a exercise sheet
      which includes both exercises testing the students' ability to perform
      basic addition in the value range 1 to 10, while also testing their (new)
      ability to extend on that knowledge and perform addition on the simplest
      values up to 20<a href="#calculus_levels_footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>You may be interested to read the technical documentation during or
        after completing this example: there you will found a complete listing
        of the abilities of the exercises generator: it can generate a myriad
        of exercises, which cover a large section of primary school calculus
        education, including advanced subjects such as <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_fraction">fractions</a>, <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">GCD (greatest
        common divisor)</a> / <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">LCD (lowest
        common denominator)</a> / <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple">LCM (least common
        multiple)</a> and more. We advise you to 'play' with the presets
        available on the web form once you've followed through this example to
        get a 'feel' for the way the presets work.</p>

        <p>We also advice you to try the <a href="#sample4">next example</a>
        because, while it may seem daunting at first, it also shows you a
        better view at the reach, i.e. the possibilities of the system, which
        will surely provide you with some new, refreshing ideas how to use this
        system to create any calculus exercises and/or test sets you may
        desire.</p>

  <h1>TO BE COMPLETED</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html" target=
    "sample_exercise">web form here (opens in another window / tab in your
    browser)</a> which is the same as in our <a href="#sample2">previous
    example</a>.</li>

    <li>
      <p>Go to the section titled <a href=
      "calculus_gen_form2.html#Select_presets_and_submit" target=
      "sample_exercise">Select preset(s) and submit</a> by either clicking on
      the link in the table of contents at the top of that page or by scrolling
      down.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Then click on the item called 'simple additions in the range 1..10' in
      the (scrollable) preset pick list. This will be the second item in that
      list. Once clicked, this item will be 'marked' and consequently show as a
      line with a blue (i.e. 'selected' background).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Press the CONTROL (or COMMAND) key on your keyboard and keep it
      depressed until we are done with the next action. We do this so you can
      select more presets to go with that first one we just picked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Now click on the item called 'additions in the range 15..19' to
      <em>also</em> select that preset, resulting in a set of <em>two</em>
      selected presets, each marked by the usual blue selection bar.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Release the CONTROL (or COMMAND) key.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Scroll down until you see the section titled <a href=
      "calculus_gen_form2.html#Page_Setup" target="sample_exercise">Page
      Setup</a>. Find the checkmark item titled 'Show Answer Sheet' in there
      and make sure both that one and the 'Show Exercises' check mark boxes are
      ticked to produce both exercises and answers at the same time, just like
      you learned in the previous two examples.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Scroll down until you see the button titled 'OK to Generate'. Click on
      the button ('OK to Generate') to submit your request to the web server;
      wait a little while for the generated exercise page to appear.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the exercise page shows both the exercises (4 columns of them)
  and the answers to them as you would expect. Of course, you may want to
  return to the web form and uncheck one of the check mark boxes mentioned
  above to <em>only</em> generate either the exercises or the answers
  sheet...</p>

    proper answer sheet(s) with you at all times. Judiciously printing a little
    extra like that can save a lot of stress and confusion for you and
    consequently improve your efficiency and effectivity as your attention will
    not waver needlessly.</p>

  <h1>Technical Documentation</h1>

  <p>This part describes all the commands and options available with the
  calculus generator. Some examples are included to enhance understanding of
  the subject matter.</p>

  <h2>Interfacing</h2>

  <p>The calculus generator can be accessed using GET and/or POST web requests;
  if you need examples of both, you might wish to have a look at the HTML
  sources for the generic web form <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html">here</a>
  and <a href="calculus_gen_form.html">here</a> and the links to the calculus
  generator PHP page in the <a href="calculus_programme.html">education
  calendar</a>. Otherwise also have a look at the info provided by <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_form">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

  <p>When issuing a GET request, you should concatenate your selected set of
  tags (see table below for a list of those) according to <a href=
  "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC3986</a>. See also <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">Wikipedia</a> for more info.</p>

  <p>When using a POST request, you should adhere to <a href=
  "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC2616</a>. (<a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Transfer_Protocol">Wikipedia</a>)
  Some features (config file upload) are only possible using HTTP POST. Make
  sure you encode the posted data using the multipart/form-data MIME type as
  specified by the <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html">W3C</a> and <a href=

    <p class="CenteredLargePrint">Notes</p>

    <p>The table above lists the web form tags in the order in which these are
    processed by the calculus generator web form interface.</p>

    <p>Behind the scenes, these URL query string tags are all converted to
    equivalent config file lines, where the uploaded <code>ConfigFile</code>
    file contents and the <code>CustomConfigText</code> field value (i.e. the
    <em>&lt;textarea&gt;</em> content) are copied verbatim.</p>

    <p>Also note that all tags are treated as optional items at this conversion
    stage and the combined results are concatenated, before the result is fed
    to the calculus generator proper. This behaviour implies that you can
    create web forms where you offer both custom config inputs
    <code>ConfigFile</code> and <code>CustomConfigText</code> at the same time.
    This is a legal use of the web form interface; when a user specifies
    content for both (i.e. specifies a config file for upload <em>and</em>
    enters one or more lines in the <code>CustomConfigText</code> field, both
    bits of content are concatenated in the order as shown in the table above,
    which means the <code>CustomConfigText</code> content will follow the
    content of the uploaded config file. See <a href=
    "calculus_gen_form2.html">here</a> for such a web form.</p>
  </blockquote>See the documentation about the config file format below for
  more info about the various tags and their precise behaviour.

  <h2>The presets</h2>

  <p>The <code>preset:</code> config field (and the <code>PresetCfg[]</code>
  URL query string tag) can specify a single preset ID. When you upload a
  custom config file, you can specify your own <em>additional</em> presets
  between any set of <code>styles_def_start:</code> and
  <code>styles_def_end:</code> marker lines (see also the config file format
  description below), but the standard set of presets available with the
  calculus generator is available <a href="presets.txt">here</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="CenteredLargePrint">Obscure Information</p>

    <p>This <a href="presets.txt">preset textfile</a> is always loaded by the
    calculus generator before your (custom) config/request data is processed.
    Hence you cannot override these presets as with presets the rule applies:
    first come is first served. I.e. any two presets, both called 'AA', will
    only have the first of these used throughout the config file parse process,

          <p>Given multiple occurrences of a certain global option throughout
          the (expanded) config/instruction file, the following rule applies:
          the last active occurrence of each global option applies. Here we
          mean with active that only those global option lines are regarded
          which remain after all presets have been expanded.</p>

          <p>An example may help. This completely fictious example:</p>
          <pre>
<strong>styles_def_start</strong>:
<strong>A1</strong>
glob_opt1: A
---
<strong>A2</strong>
glob_opt1: B
---
B3
preset: A2
---
<strong>styles_def_end</strong>:
glob_opt1: C
preset: B3
glob_opt1: D
</pre>

          <p>... will be expanded thus (while implicitly declaring that
          <code>glob_opt1: A</code> line in preset A1 very
          <em><strong>in</strong>active</em> indeed):</p>
          <pre>
glob_opt1: C

# B3 leads to A2 leads to this:
glob_opt1: B

glob_opt1: D
</pre>

          <p>... which will be parsed as if this had been written instead:</p>
          <pre>
# last occurrence wins:
glob_opt1: D
</pre>

        <p>where <code><em>preset_ID</em></code> is any non-whitespace
        character sequence, preferably consisting of alphanumeric and/or

  <p>Followed by an integer number. This number is used as-is to generate
  another 'chapter' of exercises.</p>

  <p>The combination of <em>all</em> settings, including chapter number,

  <p>Default: "%d". Can be anything, but should include that "%d" too to

  <p>Can be used to add a custom category code or other to the chapter, e.g.
  "A-%d" will display as Chapter A-1 for chapter number == 1.</p>

exercise_count:
</pre>

  <p>Absolute maximum number of exercises to generate for this chapter. Note
  that depending on limitations put to the generator, <em>less</em> exercises
  <em>may</em> be produced, but <em>never</em> more.</p>

  <p>Default: 64</p>
  <pre>
display_columns:
</pre>

  <p>Sets the number of columns to display the exercises in. Must be an integer
  number &gt;= 1. Default: 4</p>
  <pre>
display_exercises:
</pre>

  <p>Boolean as integer: 0 is FALSE (default), 1 is TRUE. When TRUE the
  exercises will be printed.</p>
  <pre>
display_answers:
</pre>

  <p>Boolean as integer: 0 is FALSE (default), 1 is TRUE. When TRUE the answers
  to the exercises will be printed.</p>

  <p>Of course, this can be combined with 'display_exercises:1' so both
  exercises and answers are shown.</p>

  <p>Boolean as integer: 0 is FALSE (default), 1 is TRUE. When TRUE some tech
  stats are printed at the bottom of the generated page.</p>
  <pre>
display_command_copy:
</pre>

  <p>Boolean as integer: 0 is FALSE (default), 1 is TRUE. When TRUE the
  complete command sequence required to exactly reproduce the generated page is
  printed at the bottom of the generated page. This is useful as you can copy
  that info to a local document / file and copy &amp; paste it into the web
  form's text edit box (bottom half; see also our <a href="#sample4">example #4
  above</a>) to exactly recreate this particular exercise sheet.</p>
  <pre>
shuffled_repeat_count:
</pre>

  <p>Integer number &gt;= 0 (default: 0) which configures the number of copies
  of the exercise collection should be made to attempt to produce the
  'exercise_count' exercises after all, even when the system did not turn up
  'exercise_count' unique exercises. Will pick random exercises from the
  already existing ones and append them to the exercises.</p>
  <pre>
try_single_limit:
</pre>

  <p>Integer number &gt; 0 (default: 40): increase to make the code try harder
  (i.e. perform more trials) to generate your desired exercises.</p>

</pre>
  <pre>
preset:
</pre>

  <p>You can reference the standard presets and/or your own presets using this
  line: the ID following the ':' colon identifies the preset you wish to
  insert/use at this spot in your command sequence; if the ID cannot be found
  anywhere in the preset definition collection, an error will be issued.</p>

  (<code>cmd</code>) / Style Definitions</a></h2>

  <p>A style definition is a single line, which defines one particular set of
  tests and ranges, which will produce the desired exercises.</p>

  <p>A style definition line is a collection of words, each separated by
  whitespace. Some may have an argument, separated by an '=' assignment
  character; the '=' may be surrounded by whitespace.</p>

  <p>The first word of a style line is the 'operator' definition, i.e. the type
  of operation we want exercises to be generated for.</p>

        which only produce a very limited number of possible exercises, e.g.
        sums from 1..5. However, smart students with large short term memory
        will recognize 'this one occurred before' and just copy the answers
        from a previous column.</p>
