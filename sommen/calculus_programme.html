  <p>This (web) tool can be used to generate unlimited series of calculus
  exercises for primary school children. You can either select one or more
  'presets' (Use CONTROL or SHIFT key with the mouse to select multiple presets
  at once) in the top half of the web form <a href=
  "calculus_gen_form2.html">here</a> or <a href=
  "calculus_gen_form.html">here</a> and/or specify your own custom exercise
  setup in the bottom half of the web form <a href=
  "calculus_gen_form2.html">here</a>.</p>

    <dt>Exercise</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A single 'sum'.</p>

      <p>This use of the term 'exercise' is slightly off from the usual meaning
      in (primary) school. In this system, 'exercise' is a <em>single item to
      work on</em>. As the <em>basic element of this system</em> is the 'sum'
      itself and <em>not</em> the 'sheet' of paper it is printed on or the
      'task', i.e. the collection of sums of which this one sum will be but a
      small part, this may lead to a bit of confusion at first. See also why we
      use the term 'exercise' like that in the description of the term 'style'
      below.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Chapter</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A single collection of sums (exercises); often&mdash;but not
      necessarily&mdash;all these exercises are of one type (a.k.a. 'style').
      One 'chapter' can be thought of as one sheet of sums. Technically,
      'chapters' are sequence numbers identifying different sheets of exercises
      of the same type (or collection of types ('styles')).</p>

      <p>As such, <em>a 'chapter' number does not uniquely identify the
      exercise sheet</em>! (See the <a href="#sample4">fourth example</a> for a
      (partial) solution for this. See also the tips in the preceding examples,
      for example <a href="#TIP_remember_your_settings">here</a>, for other
      ways to cope with this.)</p>

      <p>Think of a 'chapter' as a single task or exercise sheet.</p>

      <p>'Chapters' are designed to be handed out to students as one-at-a-time
      tests: a 'chapter' is a unit of work for a student and should be
      completed on a single day. You may choose to hand out 'chapters' in
      bundles and/or request the student to complete multiple exercises
      ('chapters') on a single day; that is up to you and the situation.
      However, a 'chapter' should be completed, once started.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Style (a.k.a. 'type')</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>An exercise definition, which is used by the generator to
      produce/select a series of exercises of this particular type. A style,
      for instance, instructs the generator to produce <em>exercises</em> to
      help the student <em>exercise</em> a particular subject, say, the
      addition of integer numbers up to 20. (Hence the name '<em>exercise</em>'
      for a single 'sum'; once you arrive at the stage where you are going to
      test [the tables of] multiplication, division and, later still, fractions
      and beyond, the word 'sum' does not cover it anymore, as these are not
      'sums' (additions) but rather different calculus <em>exercises</em>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Preset</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A predefined style, or set of styles, with optional extra parameters.
      'Presets' are a technical solution, meant to help users of this calculus
      system produce exercise sheets (a.k.a. 'chapters') quickly and with
      maximum ease. Hence quite a few presets for 'first graders' (and several
      for students beyond that stage and age) are provided as one-click
      selections in the generator-driving <a href="calculus_gen_form2.html">web
      form</a>.</p>

      <p>Be aware that a 'preset' can contain one <em>or more</em> 'styles' and
      <em>can optionally contain additional parameters</em> to drive the
      calculus exercise generator. See the technical documentation if you wish
      to know more about presets, styles, their use and operation.</p>

  work?</a></h2>

  <p>This section shows you several examples of use/try, where the examples
  slowly increase in complexity, starting with he most basic, introducing you
  to the various features of the calculus exercise generator step by step.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Following through ('replaying') an example takes a few minutes only, and
    it is very useful to try a few (preferably: all of them) for you to get a
    feel for the way the system works and what it can do for you while spending
    the least amount of time on it.</p>
